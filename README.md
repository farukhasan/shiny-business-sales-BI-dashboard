- **Export Capabilities**: Data table supports standard export functions

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: R Shiny with shinydashboard
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Data Processing**: dplyr for data manipulation
- **UI Components**: shinyWidgets for enhanced input controls
- **Tables**: DT package for interactive data tables

### Data Sources
The application supports two data loading methods:

1. **Primary Data Source**: Sales data from GitHub repository
   - URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kianoush-h/Analysis-of-Sales-Data/master/data/sales_data_sample.csv`
   - Contains historical sales transactions with customer, product, and geographic information

2. **Fallback Data**: Synthetic dataset generated when primary source is unavailable
   - Simulates 200 sales records with realistic patterns
   - Includes data from 2023-2024 with various product lines and countries

### Data Schema
The application processes the following key data fields:

- **ORDERNUMBER**: Unique identifier for each sales transaction
- **ORDERDATE**: Transaction date (MM/DD/YYYY format)
- **SALES**: Revenue amount for each order
- **QUANTITYORDERED**: Number of items in each order
- **COUNTRY**: Geographic location of the customer
- **PRODUCTLINE**: Product category (Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Trucks, Vintage Cars, Planes)
- **DEALSIZE**: Order size classification (Small, Medium, Large)
- **STATUS**: Order fulfillment status
- **CUSTOMERNAME**: Customer identification

### Calculated Fields
The application creates additional metrics for analysis:

- **PROFIT_MARGIN**: Calculated as percentage based on sales and estimated costs
- **ORDER_SIZE**: Categorization based on quantity ordered (Small: â‰¤30, Medium: 31-50, Large: >50)
- **MONTH**: Extracted month names for temporal analysis
- **YEAR**: Extracted year for annual filtering
- **QUARTER**: Quarterly grouping for seasonal analysis

## Installation Requirements

### R Packages
```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny",
  "shinydashboard", 
  "DT",
  "plotly",
  "dplyr",
  "readr",
  "lubridate",
  "scales",
  "shinyWidgets"
))
```

### System Requirements
- R version 4.0 or higher
- RStudio (recommended for development)
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection for data loading

## Usage Instructions

### Navigation
The dashboard contains four main sections accessible via the sidebar menu:

1. **Overview**: Primary dashboard with key metrics and trend analysis
2. **Products**: Product-focused analytics and performance metrics
3. **Geography**: Geographic distribution and regional performance
4. **Data**: Complete dataset view with interactive table

### Filtering Options
Three filter controls are available in the sidebar:
- **Year Filter**: Select specific years for analysis
- **Country Filter**: Focus on particular geographic regions  
- **Product Line Filter**: Analyze specific product categories

All filters support multiple selections and include search functionality for easy navigation.

### Interactive Features
- Hover over charts for detailed data points
- Click and drag to zoom in chart areas
- Use filter controls to update all visualizations simultaneously
- Sort and search within data tables
- Export data table contents to various formats

## Performance Considerations

### Data Processing
- Efficient data loading with error handling and fallback options
- Reactive programming ensures updates only when filters change
- Optimized aggregation functions for large datasets

### User Experience
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- Fast rendering with plotly for smooth interactions
- Minimal loading times through efficient data processing

## Customization Options

### Styling
The application includes custom CSS for:
- Background colors and component styling
- Border radius and spacing adjustments
- Font sizes and menu formatting
- Color schemes for consistent branding

### Data Integration
To use your own data:
1. Replace the CSV URL in the `load_data()` function
2. Ensure column names match the expected schema
3. Adjust data type conversions as needed
4. Update calculated fields based on your business logic

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Additional visualization types (heatmaps, scatter plots)
- Advanced filtering options (date ranges, custom queries)
- Export functionality for charts and reports
- User authentication and role-based access
- Real-time data integration capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
